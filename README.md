This is a library for colourful terminal output using ANSI escape sequences.

##Bless me with your wisdom, oh colourful one.

It's so simple. All you do is call the `fansi.Pants(s string, int fg, int bg, int attrs)` function.
It should be fairly self explanatory. The constants are in the source file.
